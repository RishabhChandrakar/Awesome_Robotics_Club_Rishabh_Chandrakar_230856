I am genuinely interested in Robotics  and have a great passion for it.
In Robotics , I am really passionate about Programming for Path Planning  and Electronincs , I also have some experience in pygame , ROS . 

While studying some  content like path planning, ROS ,Computer vision my interest regarding  Robots got  even stronger . I am fascinated by the intersection of software and Hardware .

Even before coming to college , I was a member of ATL(Atal Thinkering Lab) Lab in my school , where I was involved in some models like data transfer through LiFi technology , made few simple games using pygame .

I am eager to do project on Autonomous Navigation and want to bring my imagination into reality with help of my technical skills , I am interested in  enhancing the utilities of Robots and making it more useful and efficient . I am also excited about the opportunity to learn from more experienced members of the club and to share my own knowledge and experienced with others .

I will give my best effort for project and competitions and want to contribute in software development for like path planning , simulations and dynamics of different parts of robots, etc.


I hope I will get a positive response from your side .
